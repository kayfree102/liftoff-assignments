# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
The goal of this app is to compile a fun database of hidden gems for spontaneous travellers. Users can search or add random travel activities they wouldn’t typically find on TripAdvisor. Activities can range from local restaurants, hidden dive bars, random museums and even unique mom and pop shops. Users can add text about their experience and why they recommend checking it out. 
This idea came from experiencing the stark difference between exploring a city with a local guide vs. feeling like a tourist and following  Google’s “Top Ten Things to do in …..”. It’s also just sometimes fun to check out local spots you’ve never heard of! 

### Features
User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. This allows them to add activities and cities to the app.
Search: Users will be able to search for activities or cities containing given text.
List: There will be the option to view content based upon cities or activities in list form (*still deciding how to categorize*).
Create Activity: Users will be able to create new suggested activities. These activities will appear in all future searches. 
Randomized Button: If the user is unsure of where they want to go or what they would like to do they can click the "Random" button and it will offer a random selection of city and activity.

### Technologies
MySQL
JavaScript
ASP.NET
C#

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will have to learn how to make the randomized button. Ideally I would like it to have a drop down box option where you can select a city and kind of activity (eating, shopping, exploring etc.)and only the activity is randomized based off the previous information. I will also have to revisit how to stop users from adding duplicate cities or activities.
